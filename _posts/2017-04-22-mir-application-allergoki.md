On 22nd of April 2017 we submitted our application to the <b>CALL FOR MAKERS - opencare Maker In Residence.</b>

The <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b> is the first edition of a special residency program organized by [WeMake](wemake.cc), as part of the <b>opencare</b> European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.
