During the last week we have been <b>working non-stop</b>.
We are currently focusing on the <b>kit</b> for restaurant​ owners (Guidelines for the menu, Table allergies indicator, A smart guide for coaching the restaurant staff, Personalized order book, Restaurant’s business cards for customers who do not know “Allego Kì” project, Food safety manual), and we have temporary left out the idea of the web app for restaurant research.

We believe that restaurant owners could be very important to publicize and let people know the Allergo Kì system.

In the meanwhile we also had the opportunity to interview the managers of <b>[Mare Culturale Urbano's restaurant](http://maremilano.org/home/birre-cucina/)</b>, and to develop a new prototype, together with three different types of storyboards.
