From 3rd to 17th July 2017 we interviewed <b>20 people</b> to define how to represent food allergies with icons.

We have developed a <b>new icons set</b>, looking for and then pointing out the allergen food mostly used in recipes of mediterranean diet.
For example, we have represented the “mollusk” allergen as mussels, frequently used in recipes of italian cuisine, as starter and main courses.
