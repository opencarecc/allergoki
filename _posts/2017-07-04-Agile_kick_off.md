# ALLERGO KÌ MANIFESTO

## Perché Allergo Kì?

After a brief brainstorming we realized that we are here to WeMake for these 3 reasons:

- 1_ We want people with food allergies to eat out without problems.

- 2_ Exchange and share ideas on the topic of food allergies.

- 3_ Realize our idea



## The elevator pitch

For people who are diagnosed with an allergy or intolerance in adulthood.

Who These people experience trauma because they have to change their eating habits. In addition to physical illness, food allergy also causes psychological problems causing significant trauma and further pathologies such as neurosis and depression.

The AllergoKi is an integrated communication project to help people with food allergies to eat out without problems. Not as it is today in restaurants.

Our project, providing visual media, wants to create a channel for effective communication between restaurateurs and people with food allergies.
